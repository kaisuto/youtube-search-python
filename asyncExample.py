    Call `get` or `getAll` method of StreamURLFetcher & pass response returned by `Video.get` or `Video.getFormats` as parameter to fetch direct URLs.
    Getting URLs or downloading streams using youtube-dl or PyTube is can be a slow, because of the fact that they make requests to fetch the same content, which one might have already recieved at the time of showing it to the user etc.
    StreamURLFetcher makes use of PyTube (if installed) & makes some slight improvements to functioning of PyTube.
    Avoid instantiating StreamURLFetcher more than once, it will be slow (making global object of the class will be a recommended solution).

    `get` method can be handy for getting URL of a particular kind. `getAll` returns all stream URLs in a dictionary.
